			Just like a photograph you made me feel<br/>
			like this would last forever<br/>
			Looking in your eyes<br/>
			I see my whole life<br/>
			They say you know it when you know it, and I know<br/>
			(Oh-oh-oh)<br/>
			Promise that you'll hold me close, don't let me go<br/>
			(Hey!)<br/><br/>
			Take my heart, don't break it<br/>
			Love me to my bones<br/>
			All this time I wasted<br/>
			You were right there all along<br/>
			You and I stargazing<br/>
			Intertwining souls<br/>
			We were never strangers<br/>
			You were right there all along<br/>
			I lose my mind<br/>
			When I'm around you, how I come alive<br/>
			When I'm without you, I can't help but feel so lost<br/>
			I wanna give you all I've got<br/>
			They say you know it when you know it, and I know<br/>
			(Oh-oh-oh)<br/>
			Promise that you'll hold me close, don't let me go<br/>
			(Hey!)<br/><br/>
			Take my heart, don't break it<br/>
			Love me to my bones<br/>
			All this time I wasted<br/>
			You were right there all along<br/>
			You and I stargazing<br/>
			Intertwining souls<br/>
			We were never strangers<br/>
			You were right there all along<br/>
			All along<br/>
			Take my heart, don't break it<br/>
			Love me to my bones<br/>
			All this time I wasted<br/>
			You were right there all along<br/>
